:::tip

We do not creat an new empty Docus website and build up step by step.
It is hard from 0 to 1, but easy from 1 to N.
So we fork a mature website like docusaurus.io as initial status.

:::

## Fork the Docusaurs repository 
The docusaurus.io is one of repositories in Facebook, So the [repository](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) can be forked to your orgniaztion.

## Rename the Repository on Github
To follow the github page requment, the name of the repository should adapte to thebestornothing.github.io in the settings page. ** Adapt thebestornothing to your orgniaztion name. **
